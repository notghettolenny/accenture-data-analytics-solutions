data cleaning and modelling

Here is your task
1. Requirements gathering

To complete this task, you’ll first want to look at the task that you’ve been assigned and think about which available data sets may be useful to fulfill the requirements. It may be helpful for you to write the data sets down that you think will be best for the task. You should take time to fully understand the data model and how the tables link together. Then you should think about which tables are most relevant.

2. Data cleaning

Before we begin to work with the relevant data sets, we’ll need to ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis. Data cleaning is a common and very important task when working with data. This includes removing columns that have a high number of missing values, removing rows that have values which are erroneous, changing the data type of some values within a column and also removing columns which are not relevant to this task. Your end result should be a set of relevant data sets that are clean with each data set containing only the columns which are relevant to the completion of this task.

Think about how each column that you choose can be used to fulfill the requirements of this task. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it. It may be helpful to write down which columns you think would be important to keep. 

3. Data modeling

Finally, use this knowledge to create a final data set containing all of the columns that you will need to complete the task. You can use Excel or any other tool of your choice to create your final data set. Based on which columns you think will be most useful, you may be required to merge tables together by using the Unique Keys within tables. You should spend some time modeling the data to create your final data set for this task.

All of the data sets will be provided as CSV files and you can do the data modeling in Excel or any other tool that you wish. Your final submission should be a single CSV or Excel spreadsheet containing the columns and data that you think will fulfill the requirements of this task best.
